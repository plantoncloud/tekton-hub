# Rule: Commit Tekton Hub Changes

## Purpose

When triggered, create a Git commit with an appropriate commit message following Conventional Commits format, based on the current conversation context and file changes.

## Rule Type

**Action Rule** - Executes git commit operations

## When to Use

- When user explicitly asks to commit changes
- After completing a feature or fix that's ready to be committed
- When wrapping up a development session

## Commit Message Format

Follow Conventional Commits format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### Types

Use these commit types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `refactor`: Code refactoring (no functional changes)
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Build process, tooling, dependencies
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, no logic changes)
- `ci`: CI/CD changes
- `revert`: Reverting previous commits

### Scope

Determine scope from the affected files/components:
- For API changes: Use `api`
- For UI/frontend: Use `ui`
- For database: Use `db`
- For configuration: Use `config`
- For documentation: Use `docs`
- For build/tooling: Use `build` or `tooling`
- If multiple areas: Use broader scope or omit scope

### Subject

- Use imperative mood ("add" not "added" or "adds")
- No period at the end
- Keep under 72 characters
- Be specific but concise

### Body (Optional)

Add detailed body when:
- The change is complex and needs explanation
- Multiple related changes are included
- There are breaking changes
- Context would help future developers understand "why"

Body guidelines:
- Wrap at 72 characters
- Explain what and why, not how
- Use bullet points for multiple items
- Reference issues/tickets if applicable

### Footer (Optional)

Include footer for:
- `BREAKING CHANGE:` for breaking changes
- `Closes #123` or `Fixes #123` for issue references
- Co-authored-by for pair programming

## Execution Steps

1. **Analyze Changes**
   - Check `git status` to see modified files
   - Review the conversation context to understand what was changed
   - Identify the type and scope of changes

2. **Determine Commit Type and Scope**
   - Map file changes to appropriate type
   - Determine most relevant scope from file paths

3. **Craft Commit Message**
   - Write concise subject line (< 72 chars)
   - Decide if detailed body is needed based on:
     - Complexity of changes
     - Number of related changes
     - Need for future context
   - Add footer if there are breaking changes or issue references

4. **Create Commit**
   - Stage all changes with `git add -A`
   - Commit with the crafted message using `git commit -m "subject" [-m "body"]`
   - Use `-m` flag multiple times for subject + body, or use multiline format

## Examples

### Simple Feature Addition

```bash
git commit -m "feat(api): add task validation endpoint"
```

### Bug Fix with Context

```bash
git commit -m "fix(ui): resolve task list pagination issue" \
  -m "The pagination was not working correctly when filtering by category.
This commit updates the pagination logic to properly handle filtered results."
```

### Refactoring with Multiple Changes

```bash
git commit -m "refactor(api): simplify task processing logic" \
  -m "- Extract common validation into helper functions
- Remove duplicate error handling code
- Improve readability of task execution flow
- No functional changes to behavior"
```

### Breaking Change

```bash
git commit -m "feat(api)!: change task response format to include metadata" \
  -m "BREAKING CHANGE: The task API response now includes a metadata object.
Clients must update to handle the new response structure.

This change improves API consistency and provides better task context."
```

### Changelog Addition

```bash
git commit -m "docs(changelog): add task validation feature"
```

## Command Patterns

For simple commits:
```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "<type>(<scope>): <subject>"
```

For commits with body:
```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "<type>(<scope>): <subject>" -m "<body>"
```

For commits with multi-paragraph body:
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "<type>(<scope>): <subject>" \
  -m "<paragraph 1>" \
  -m "" \
  -m "<paragraph 2>"
```

## Important Notes

- **Always run in tekton-hub workspace**: `~/scm/github.com/plantoncloud/tekton-hub`
- **Don't commit without reviewing**: Show the proposed commit message to the user before executing if the changes are significant
- **Stage selectively if needed**: If only some changes should be committed, stage specific files instead of `git add -A`
- **Don't skip hooks**: Never use `--no-verify` unless explicitly requested
- **Check for unstaged changes**: Review `git status` output to ensure all intended changes are staged

## Error Handling

If commit fails:
- Check if there are actually changes to commit
- Verify you're in the correct directory
- Check if a commit is already in progress (merge/rebase)
- Ensure commit message format is valid

## Workflow Integration

This rule works well with:
- `@create-tekton-hub-changelog.mdc` - Create changelog before committing major features
- After completing a development task
- Before creating a pull request

## Execution

When this rule is triggered:

1. Navigate to tekton-hub workspace
2. Run `git status` to check current changes
3. Analyze changes and conversation context
4. Propose commit message following the format above
5. Execute the commit command with appropriate permissions (git_write)
6. Confirm successful commit
