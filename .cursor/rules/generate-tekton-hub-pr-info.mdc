# Rule: Pull Request Title and Description (ask-only)

Purpose: When asked to write a PR title and PR description, respond with exactly two copyable code blocks — first the title, then the description — without making any repository changes.

This rule is designed for ask mode only. Do not modify files, run commands, or propose edits. Output only the two fenced code blocks described below.

Usage: In Ask mode, invoke explicitly as `@generate-tekton-hub-pr-info`.

## How to respond (strict)
1) First block: PR Title
   - Fenced code block with language: `text`
   - Single line only
   - Prefix using Conventional Commits: one of `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `perf`, `ci`, `build`, `chore`, `revert`
   - Scope is required and derived from changed files (examples below)
   - Imperative mood, concise, ≤ 72 characters after the prefix
   - No trailing period

2) Second block: PR Description
   - Fenced code block with language: `markdown`
   - Use the following sections when applicable. Omit any that are not relevant.
     - "Summary": 1–3 sentences describing what this PR does in plain language
     - "Context": Why this change is needed (problem, bug, or goal)
     - "Changes": Bullet list of key changes; group by area if helpful
     - "Implementation notes": Important design decisions or trade-offs
     - "Breaking changes": Clearly call out any breaking behavior and migration steps
     - "Test plan": How this was verified (tests, manual steps, screenshots/links)
     - "Risks": Known risks or rollback plan
     - "Checklist": Markdown checkboxes for docs, tests, backward compatibility
     - Optionally include issue links like `Closes #123` when known

## Title format (exactly)

```text
<prefix>(<scope>): <concise, imperative title>
```

- Examples of valid scopes: `api`, `ui`, `db`, `config`, `ci`, `docs`, `build`, `tests`, `repo`.

## How to infer the title prefix
- `feat`: Adds a new capability, endpoint, UI feature, or functionality
- `fix`: Corrects a bug or regression
- `refactor`: Code restructuring without changing externally visible behavior
- `docs`: Documentation-only changes (README, guides, comments)
- `test`: Tests only
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `ci`: CI pipeline/config changes
- `build`: Build system or dependency changes
- `chore`: Routine maintenance (formatting, small cleanups) not covered above
- `revert`: Reverts a previous commit/PR

Prefer `feat` vs `refactor` based on whether user-facing capability is introduced. Prefer `fix` when the primary intent is to resolve a defect, even if some refactoring was required.

## Scope heuristics (Tekton Hub)
Determine the `<scope>` from the changed files. Use the most impacted area by lines changed; if multiple, see multi-area guidance below.

- API/Backend
  - `api/` → `api`
  
- UI/Frontend
  - `ui/` → `ui`

- Database
  - `db/` or database migrations → `db`

- Configuration
  - `config/` or configuration files → `config`

- CI/CD
  - `.github/workflows/`, CI configs → `ci`

- Documentation
  - `docs/`, `README.md` → `docs`

- Build system
  - `Makefile`, build scripts, dependencies → `build`

- Tests
  - Test files across the repo → `tests`

- Project configuration
  - Root config files (`.gitignore`, etc.) → `repo`

### Multi-area changes
- If changes span multiple areas at the same level, use a broader scope or `repo`
- If changes are broadly cross-cutting (≥3 unrelated areas), use `repo`

## Inputs to use when generating
- The full diff and edit history from this session
- Changed files and their paths to infer scope using the rules above
- Commit messages, branch name, or linked issues if available

If context is insufficient to infer details, choose the best effort scope from filenames and touched areas. Do not ask questions; still produce both blocks.

## Output blocks (exactly two, nothing else)

```text
<prefix>(<scope>): <concise, imperative title>
```

```markdown
## Summary
<1–3 sentences>

## Context
<why this change was needed>

## Changes
- <key change 1>
- <key change 2>
- <key change 3>

## Implementation notes
- <notable decision or trade-off>

## Breaking changes
- <explicitly list or state "None">

## Test plan
- <how verified>

## Risks
- <risks and rollback>

## Checklist
- [ ] Docs updated (if needed)
- [ ] Tests added/updated (if needed)
- [ ] Backward compatible

<!-- Optionally: Closes #123 -->
